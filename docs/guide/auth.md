# Firebase Authentication

[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start) makes it really easy to add different kind of authentications to your app and integrate with security rules for Firestore and Database.
Most of the APIs can be used as you would normally do with Firebase, VueFire exposes a few composables to integrate better with Vue:

## Installation

Start by adding the `VueFireAuth` module to the `VueFire` plugin:

```ts
import { VueFire, VueFireAuth } from 'vuefire'
app.use(VueFire, {
  firebaseApp: createFirebaseApp(),
  modules: [
    // ... other modules
    VueFireAuth(),
  ],
})
```

This will automatically initialize and inject the [Auth module](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start#add-initialize-sdk) as well as the other features described in this page.

## Auth instance

You can access the current Auth instance in any component with the `useFirebaseAuth()` composable:

```vue
<script setup>
const auth = useFirebaseAuth()
</script>
```

## Current User

You can get the current user as a reactive variable with the `useCurrentUser()` composable:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useCurrentUser } from 'vuefire'

const user = useCurrentUser()
</script>

<template>
  <p v-if="user">Hello {{ user.providerData.displayName }}</p>
</template>
```

### Wait for the user to be loaded

There is also a `getCurrentUser()` function that returns a promise of the current user. This is useful if you want to wait for the user to be loaded before doing anything. You can, for example, await it within a navigation guard:

```ts
router.beforeEach(async (to) => {
  // routes with `meta: { requiresAuth: true }` will check for the users, others won't
  if (to.meta.requiresAuth) {
    const currentUser = await getCurrentUser()
    // if the user is not logged in, redirect to the login page
    if (!currentUser) {
      return {
        path: '/login',
        query: {
          // we keep the current path in the query so we can redirect to it after login
          // with `router.push(route.query.redirect || '/')`
          redirect: to.fullPath,
        },
      }
    }
  }
})
```

::: tip
If you are using `getCurrentUser()` in a navigation guard, make sure to add it before calling `app.use(router)` as that will trigger the initial navigation.
:::

Once the user is loaded, `getCurrentUser()` will immediately resolve the current user.

Sometimes, the Firebase SDK might be able to automatically log in the user with a hidden cookie or local storage. In that case, you can automatically redirect the user to the page they were trying to access before being automatically logged in:

```ts
// within the Page component displayed for the `/login` route
onMounted(async () => {
  const currentUser = await getCurrentUser()
  if (currentUser) {
    const to =
      route.query.redirect && typeof route.query.redirect === 'string'
        ? route.query.redirect
        : '/'

    router.push(to)
  }
})
```
